    <h1>Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!</h1>
    <p>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.</p>

    <script>
      // JavaScript for basic interaction, if needed
      // (though your example doesn't require client-side scripting)
    </script>

    <p>To play the game, run the Python script below:</p>
    <pre>
import random

def main():
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
    guessed_correctly = False

    # Game loop
    while not guessed_correctly:
        try:
            # Get the player's guess
            guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            # Check if the guess is correct
            if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low.")
            elif guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Too high.")
            else:
                guessed_correctly = True
                print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number {number_to_guess} correctly.")
                print(f"It took you {attempts} attempts.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    </pre>
